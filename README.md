# GraphWalker_Selenium

This is a simple example of using GraphWalker with Selenium. 

In order to run this code it is only needed to indicate where is the chromedriver located "     System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/Users/manue/testAutomation_GraphWalker_MasterThesis/chromedriver.exe");" 

If you have any suggestion or this code is useful for you, let me know. 

Thank you
Manuela
